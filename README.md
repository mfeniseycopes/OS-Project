OS-Project
==========

For Operating Systems course at Brooklyn College.

The project is a simulation of an operating system. The program works together with an existing program (SOS) that simulates a job stream. SOS feeds the program a series of jobs and job requests; like a real operating system, the program must field those requests and handle the life cycle of each of the jobs, from system entry to termination.
